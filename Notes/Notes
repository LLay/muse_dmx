Notes

Females have higher EEG Power

: Training with beta neurofeedback is associated with increased attention
308 and arousal, which is thought to explain both lower reaction times and improved sensitivity in
309 a sustained attention task (Egner and Gruzelier, 2004).

Calibration:	Normally, when a user puts on the headset, they're told to spend three 20 second intervals thinking as hard as they can about examples of a class, e.g "Animals" we may want to keep track of this baseline.
Alpha 	"Alpha waves predominantly in posterior region of brain
Mu waves associated with front"
Mu waves	Associated with hand motion?
Power in the rear generally stronger than front	
Femals have higher EEG power in most bands	
, increased beta power 305 in older adults may be consistent with work demonstrating an association between poor attention 306 and beta modulation	
: Training with beta neurofeedback is associated with increased attention 308 and arousal, which is thought to explain both lower reaction times and improved sensitivity in 309 a sustained attention task (Egner and Gruzelier, 2004).	
Sustained visual attention has also been 310 linked to beta activity (WrÂ´obel, 2000), underscoring the importance of understanding how beta 311 activity changes with age, and whether these changes are associated with age-related changes in 312 attention.	
Alpha power is known 317 to be modulated by task demands (Payne et al., 2013), fatigue (Crabbe and Dishman, 2004), and 318 mindfulness meditation (Kerr et al., 2011), all of which are likely at play during use of the Muse	
. It is also worth saying that correlations 331 between alpha peak frequency and cognitive measures should consider the role of beta, given our 332 earlier discussion of beta power being associated with attentional control.
